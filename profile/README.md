# **The Programming Club**



## Who we are...
We are a community of passionate programmers and aim to improve the coding culture of our university. We believe in a community where, irrespective of your academic background, or who you are, if you are interested in logical thinking, problem solving and technology in general, this might be an ideal place for you. 


## What we do...
We put an effort in developing a thriving culture that ranges from conducting talks and sessions that fill the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical real-world problems. We cover topics such as data science, website and application development, machine learning, etc. through our beginner-friendly events. We also hold hands-on workshops because we also believe in learning by doing.

If you are interested in building cool stuff, learning about new tech, or even solving puzzles this might be the right place for you!!
